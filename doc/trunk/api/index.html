<h1>MP4v2 API Documentation</h1>
<p>
The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files as defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accomodate practic ally any type of media.<p>
The basic structure of an mp4 file is that the file is a container for one or more tracks. These tracks contain one type of media, such as audio or video. Each track has its own timeline, samples, and properties. An example of a sample is a frame of video. The file describes how to synchronize the timelines of the tracks and the aggregate properties of the tracks.<p>
The MP4v2 library is focussed on providing an easy to use API for the mp4 file format. It has been used with an encoder, a server, a player, and a number of mp4 utilities. However, it may not be adequate for multimedia editors that wish to work directly with mp4 files. It can be used by these type of tools to export an mp4 file.<p>
In providing a easy to use API not all the information in the mp4 file is directly exposed via the API. To accomodate applications that need access to information not othe rwise available via the API there are file and track level generic get and set property routines that use arbitary string property names. To use these routines you will need to be familar with the mp4 file specification or be willing to wade through the output of <a class="el" href="group__mp4__fileops.html#g1ba6729bc9a427fff9ff49b91ca16157" title="Dump mp4 file contents as ASCII.">MP4Dump()</a> to determine what you want. See MP4GetIntegerProperty() for more etails.<h2><a class="anchor" name="invocation">

The public libary API is defined in <code>&lt;<a class="el" href="mp4v2_8h-source.html">mp4v2/mp4v2.h</a>&gt;</code> which includes all the necessary dependent header files. You should never use any other header files from MP4v2 sources.<p>
The MP4v2 library can be used by either C or C++ programs. The calling convention is C but for convenience if C++ is used default function arguments have been added where appropriate:<p>
