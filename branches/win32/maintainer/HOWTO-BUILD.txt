Maintainer Build Insutructions
******************************

Project maintainers typically build directly from the repository,
which adds more prerequisites than the INSTALL procedure used
with dist-bundles.


REQUIREMENTS
============

At the time of this writing, general requirements for building from
the repository are to have the following tools available in your
path:

GENERAL
-------
    - subversion 1.5.0 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - GNU autoconf 2.61 or higher (lower versions will NOT work)
    - GNU automake 1.10 or higher (lower versions will NOT work)
    - GNU libtool 1.5.26 or higher (lower versions might work)
    - GNU make 3.81 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - GNU gcc 4.0.0 or higher (gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
    - Doxygen 1.5.7 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - GNU texinfo 4.8 or higher (lower versions should work)

PACKAGING
---------
    - GNU tar 1.15.1 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - GNU gzip 1.3.10 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - bzip2 1.0.4 or higher (lower versions should work)
    - Info-ZIP zip 2.32 or higher (lower versions should work)


WORKFLOW
========

1. Checkout trunk or a branch from the respoitory.
2. Generate autotool files.
3. Configure.
4. Create dist-bundle.


WORKFLOW - TRUNK-BUILD
----------------------

By default debug,optimize compiler-options are enabled, and static,shared
libraries are created. In this example we choose to disable optimize
and static during development and to use /tmp/TEST as the installation
directory.

    cd /work/mp4v2/
    svn co https://mp4v2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    cd trunk/
    autoreconf -fiv
    mkdir build/
    cd build/
    ../configure --disable-optimize --disable-static --prefix=/tmp/TEST
    make
